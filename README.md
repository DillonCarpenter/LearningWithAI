## Types of Neural Networks
- Perceptrons
- Feed Forward Networks (FNNs)
- And more
---
## Activation Functions
- Decide how signal the node sends
- Without them neural networks are basically just ax + b = y
- They introduce non-linearity by modifying the results of the linear transformation of each node
- This allows neural networks to approximate any complex function
