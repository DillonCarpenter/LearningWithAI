# Neural Network Architecture
---
## Why I want to learn it
- They are a core part of moder AI and machine learning
- Have lots of potential applications
---
## How I will learn with AI
- Discovery of new terms
- Summarizing for subtopics
- Providing examples
---
## Types of Neural Networks
- Perceptrons
- Feed Forward Networks (FNNs)
- And more
---
## Activation Functions
- Decide how signal the node sends
- Without them neural networks are basically just ax + b = y
- They introduce non-linearity by modifying the results of the linear transformation of each node
- This allows neural networks to approximate any complex function
